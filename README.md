# Allan Lam
Hello! Iâ€™m a Ph.D. candidate in Experimental Psychology with a specialization in Computational Social Science at UC San Diego!

ðŸ§  I have a background in behavioral research with a strong foundation in human cognition, decision-making, and user-centered design.

# What is Computational Social Science?
Computational Social Science (CSS) is an interdisciplinary field that blends social science theory with computational tools. CSS researchers apply data science methods to study complex social behaviors. With training in both statistics and psychology, I aim to bridge the gap between human behavior and data-driven innovation.

# Interests
ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently researching eyewitness identification and memory mechanisms in police lineups. I also investigate social judgements of faces. 

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning UX research methodologies to design better human-centered products and technologies.

ðŸš€ In the future, I hope to continue transforming abstract data into insights that explain behavior and inform better decisions. 

# Languages & Tools: 
R, Qualtrics, JavaScript, Notion, Figma

# Skills: 
ROC analysis, GLM, NHST, experimental design, human subjects research
