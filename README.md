# Allan Lam

I am a researcher and analyst with a doctorate in Experimental Psychology and a specialization in Computational Social Science. My background encompasses user experience research, legal research, and academic research, providing me with a unique perspective on gathering, analyzing, and applying data to solve complex problems. Whether I'm designing experiments, conducting user studies, or modeling complex datasets, I bring a rigorous, data-driven approach to understanding human behavior and decision-making. My passion for storytelling, honed through my interest in movies, informs my ability to communicate research findings in a compelling and accessible way to diverse audiences. I am adept at collaborating with cross-functional teams, managing projects effectively, and translating research insights into actionable recommendations.
