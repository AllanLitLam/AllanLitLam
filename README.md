### üöÄ Featured Impact & Expertise

**Eyewitness Confidence: Driving Judicial Reform**

My [research](https://github.com/AllanLitLam/diagnostic-eyewitnesss-confidence-at-initial-test) established the new scientific consensus on eyewitness reliability. The findings confirmed that only an **immediate, initial confidence statement is diagnostic of accuracy**, leading to the overturn of a wrongful conviction after 25 years.

### üìÅ Portfolio Highlights (Pinned Repositories)

* [Cyclistic Bike-Share Case Study](https://github.com/AllanLitLam/case-study-cyclistic): **Modeled user behavior (GLM)** to increase annual membership conversion by incentivizing long-duration, leisure-focused weekend trips.
* [Fake News vs. Hard Content](https://github.com/AllanLitLam/fake-news-vs-hard-content): Used **NLP Topic Modeling** to show that misinformation strategically focuses on non-political soft topics (health, lifestyle) to maximize propagation, providing a blueprint for counter-misinformation.
* [Filler Similarity Effect on Lineup Memory Performance](https://github.com/AllanLitLam/filler-similarity-and-lineup-size-effect-on-memory-performance): Applied **Signal Detection Theory** to judicial policy, demonstrating that the optimal lineup size is critically dependent on filler similarity.
